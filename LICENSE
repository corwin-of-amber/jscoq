Comment: Derived from js_of_ocaml (https://github.com/ocsigen/js_of_ocaml).
 (if js_of_ocaml updates to LGPL2.1+, then these should be updated to the same.)

# Regarding Coq and derivatives:

We currently have no "direct derivative" from Coq, which is under the
LGPL 2.1, however:

  - jscoq.ml was based on Coq's source at some point.

  - the Ocaml code in icoq.ml is tightly integrated with Coq, it could
    be considered to derive from it.
